        Human mission to Mars

      <p class="text-block">
        A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since
        the 1880s, and of aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <b>since
        the late 1940s.</b> Plans include landing on Mars for exploration at a
        minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos and Deimos.
        Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting
        terraforming of the planet.

          The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for
          decades. Conceptual work for missions that would involve human
          explorers has been ongoing <b>since the 1950s</b>, with planned missions
          typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30
          years from the time they are drafted.The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission
          plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by
          multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space
          exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a
          small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a
          period of a few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through
          research stations, colonization or other continuous
          humanization).<q>Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic
          technologies, have also been proposed.</q>
          <br />
          <i>In the 2010s</i>, numerous US,
          European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human
          missions to Mars.<q>In fiction, Mars is a frequent
          target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and
          films.</q>
